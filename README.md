# .NET-student-API

This API allows you to manage students.

Developed with:<br/>
üë®‚Äçüíª  .NET CORE <br/>
üíæ  SQlite Database <br/>
‚è≥  Redis for distributed caching <br/>

Why Distributed Caching using Redis?
The server remembers HTTP requests for the last 10 sec.
if the same request comes up again, the response will be retrieved from Redis cache instead of querying the DB again, for better performance.

This is my first expirience with .NET CORE & Redis
